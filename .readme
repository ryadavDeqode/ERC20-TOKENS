Please avoid testing.js and testing2.js files!

Approach : 

1.Go through blocks and get all txn hashes
2.From txn hashes get those txns which deployed a smart contract
3.now filter out only those smart contract which are erc20 standard tokens
4.Fill the database with erc20 token addresses which will be used to get holders.
